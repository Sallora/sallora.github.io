<p> Either because you don’t get enough sleep, you have iron deficiency or you just had a crazy night out last night, getting rid of under eye circle is a struggle for most women on a daily basis. Before you rush to the drugstore and start spending money on countless eye creams and cosmetics, try the tips below for a more natural treatment.</p>

<h5>1. Cucumber</h5>
<p>For a quick solution on puffiness and dark circles, cucumber should be your go-to remedy. Cucumber is astringent and lightens the skin, therefore it can naturally help reduce those panda eyes and leave your skin soft and fresh. The cold temperature is a key here. Cut a few thick slices of cucumber – after you let it chill in the refrigerator for a while, put the slices under your eyes ensuring you are covering the bags and leave them for about 10-15 minutes. After you finish, wash the area off with some water.</p>

<h5>2. Raw Potato</h5>

<p>Potato has almost the same effect as the cucumber. It can naturally help lighten the dark circles and reduce the puffiness. Wash and cut a few slices of potato, place them on or under your eyes and leave them on for 10-20 minutes and then wash it off with some water. [For better results, you can place the potato in the fridge for 30 mins and then use it].</p>

<h5>3. Tea Bags</h5>

<p>If you don’t have any of the above, a tea bag will also do the trick. The tannin and antioxidants in tea can massively help in reducing swelling and dark circles. Soak two tea bags in warm water and chill them in the fridge for about 20-30 minutes. Place one tea bag on each eye and leave them for about 10-15 minutes. After you finish, wash your face with cold water. TIP: Keep your eyes closed while using the tea bags to avoid getting tea in your eyes.</p>

<h5>4. Rose Water</h5>

<p>Is no accident rose water is been used in different skin care products. It’s ingredient does miracles to the skin. It regenerates it and soothes tired eyes. Soak cotton eye pads in rose water for a few minutes and apply them on closed eyes for about 15 minutes. For better results, repeat this twice a day for a few weeks. </p>

 <h3>Tips to grow long, healthy hair.</h3>


<p>Even though more and more women are now getting a bob or a lob, a.k.a long bob, long hair will never go out of fashion. There’s something about the whole ‘Rapunzel look’ that makes women want it right here, right now.</p>

<p>The good news; everyone can grow their hair (hooray!). The bad news, it needs patience and it takes time. The average person’s hair grows a quarter of an inch per month. However with the right treatment and hair care, you will soon have long, lasting hair to die for.</p>

<h5> 1. Become friends with the enemy; get regular trims.</h5>

<p>While regularly trimming your hair is both ironic and terrifying, and it won’t actually make your hair grow, it will keep it healthy and will prevent splits. Having split ends means you will get a shorter cut than if you just get your regular trim. Getting a trim, will allow your hair to grow without breaking.</p>

<h5> 2. Don’t shampoo every day.</h5>

<p>Washing your hair 2-4 times a week is a must in growing your hair (or it’s a rule you should live by it). When you wash your hair every day, you take away all the natural oils your hair needs to stay healthy and avoid split ends. Whenever possible try to avoid shampooing too often – be careful though; don’t let your hair get dehydrated which can lead you to itchiness and dryness.</p>

<h5> 3. Finish your shower with a cool rinse.</h5>

<p>This is a tip that really helps your hair grow and be more healthy. Cold water prevents hair from getting damaged, it strengthens it and keeps it smooth. When you finish conditioning your hair (which you should never forget in order to help it get smoother and stronger),rinse it with cool water for a few seconds and thank us later. Small step, huge difference.</p>

<h5> 4. Avoid heat whenever possible.</h5>

<p>One thing every woman does undoubtedly, is using heat. Whether that is to straighten our hair, curly it or just dry it, we fire away without even thinking about it. Heat makes hair more frizzy and leads to breakage. Whenever possible try avoiding heat. Let your hair dry naturally and give it a ‘holiday style look’ by wearing it natural. If you must use heat, then decrease the temperature of your styling tool, pick tools with ceramic technology and always, always use a heat protectant.</p>


<p>There you have it. Make sure you follow these simple and yet efficient ways and let us know in the comments how it’s going for you and if you have any other tips to share.</p></div>

    <h3>What if there were more women in tech?
</h3>


<p>From gender-neutral bots to period-friendly healthcare trackers, cars with more storage and clothes with bigger pockets - the world could be a very different place if there were more women working in tech.</p>

<p>We asked a group of women who are working in the fields of science, technology, engineering and maths (Stem) how the world might be compared to now, if more women were present in these male-dominated industries.</p>

<p>Now in its eighth year, the annual celebration of women working in Stem is named after the woman regarded as the world's first computer programmer - Ada Lovelace - because of her work with inventor Charles Babbage on his idea for an "analytical engine" in the 1800s.</p>

<p>"If there were more women working in bots. Artificial Intelligence (AI), women wouldn't be an afterthought when building new technology.
"Early voice recognition software didn't always recognise female voices, because none of the developers had been female and no-one thought to test out the technology on women (Car safety failed to take into account female anatomy - female-sized crash test dummies were only enforced in the US in 2011).</p>

<p>"Artificial Intelligence learns like babies do: it picks up data and knowledge from the world around it. So if that world is all male, it's going to have a very limited sphere of knowledge indeed.<p>

<p>"There would be more of a gender mix in AI voices - dutiful personal assistants wouldn't be largely female (Siri at launch, Cortana, Alexa) and advanced humanoid robots wouldn't be mostly male (SoftBank's robot companion NAO and, going more retro, R2D2 and Hal 9000).
"I've always been insistent that Pegg, the first accounting chatbot, that I developed at Sage, is gender neutral."</p>
